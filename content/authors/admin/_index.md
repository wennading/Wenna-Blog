Oligocene is an important stage for the modernization of the world’s vegetation. However, Oligocene flora in China especially those have an accurate geological dating is rare. During my MSc, I studied an early Oligocene macrofossil flora from southwestern China which is dated based on U-Pb method. So far, I have identified more than 30 morpho-types, 20 of which were identified at species or generic level. Dipteronia and Cryptomeria fossils have been described in detail based on gross morphology and cuticular characters. By integrating environmental requirements of fossils and extant species, I want to reveal their biogeographic history in response to climatic changes.

I am also involved in a  project led by Dr. Yaowu Xing for understanding the angiosperm diversification and biogeographic assembly processes in the Hengduan Mountains. The Hengduan Mountains region, with its rich flora and recent history of dynamic geological activity, provides unique opportunities for insight into evolutionary processes driving lineage diversification and patterns of global biodiversity.
